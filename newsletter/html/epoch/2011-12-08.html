<h1 style="color: #36317D; font-family: Helvetica; text-align: center;">Fall Semester Retrospective</h1>

<p style="font-size:1.1em; font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>UNIFI co-hosts our biggest recruitment event ever</strong></p>

<p>This fall UNIFI worked with 4 other organizations to host our biggest recruitment event yet, Progressive Picnic, which drew hundreds of students of students to Lawther field. The collaborative effort included a diverse range of student groups who all shared a few similar Humanist values. The event itself featured sandwiches, fruit, and snow cones, as well as 2 great local bands, and UNI’s improve troupe, Half Masted. Booths were also available to sponsoring groups to advertise to students.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.1em; font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>UNIFI is ‘Good Without God’ during Out Week 2011</strong></p>

<p>UNIFI held our first ever Out Week this fall, an event aimed at non-religious students on campus who do not feel comfortable being open about their beliefs, or who felt as though they lacked a voice in the larger diversity discussion. A goal of the event was to demonstrate that it’s possible to be ‘Good Without God’ by holding a food drive, cosponsoring a blood drive, and selling raffle tickets to raise money for the Northeast Iowa Food bank. </p>

<p> Numerous social events were held throughout the week, and it was capped off by our annual Flying Spaghetti Monster Dinner, which is a light-hearted celebration of the satirical take on intelligent design. Prizes from the raffle were also given out at the dinner, including hundreds of dollars of in-kind donations from local businesses, and $700 was raised in total for the Food Bank, which serves all of North East Iowa. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.1em; font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>A focus on service & Humanist values</strong></p>

<p>UNIFI has always had several key mandates - to provide a community for non-religious or questioning students, to provide intellectual stimulation and educational opportunities to its members, and to engage in activism for social and political issues, but also for charitable causes. We have made a major effort in 2011 to move away from being the “anti-religion” group on campus in favor of being the pro-humanism group on campus. </p>

<p>While criticism of religion, and other unfounded claims, is an essential part of our agenda, UNIFI can be more than just a group about attacking ideas. We can and should promote positive values, like the importance of free expression. We can and should give back to the community. We can and should move forward with an agenda to change the dialogue on campus, and we need more than just anti-theism to do that. We will continue this re-focusing into the coming months, and we will continue represent non-religious students on campus in the best way that we can. </p>

<h1 style="color: #36317D; font-family: Helvetica; text-align: center;">Darwin Week and Beyond</h1>

<p>The beginning of the spring semester always brings the promise of a new Darwin Week, and this year’s event will be bigger and better than ever before. UNIFI will host 4 days of talks centered around Diversity, Sexuality, Skepticism, and Origins - each concluding with a keynote talk given by a prominent speaker such as NPR journalist Jamila Bey, Biology Professor Clint Kelly, Professional Skeptic Joe Nickell, and Theoretical Physicist Lawrence Krauss,. Additionally, we will continue to have a large number of talks from faculty speakers on a variety of different topics. </p>

<p>Darwin Week will be held Februray 13th-16th at the University of Northern Iowa. Updates and information will be posted to DarwinWeek.com as it becomes available. </p>

<p>Looking forward to the rest of the year, we have big plans in the works for the remaining months after Darwin Week has concluded. This has been our best year ever, and we want to continue growing and serving the UNI community. Thanks for being a part of that. </p>
