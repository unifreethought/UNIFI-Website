Welcome to the UNI Freethinkers and Inquirers website! This is the code for
http://unifreethought.com. It was created by Adam Shannon for the group, and you
can contact him at adam@unifreethought.com or the current webmaster at
webmaster@unifreethought.com

REQUIREMENTS
In order to run this site you will need a webserver running, a knowledge of PHP,
MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and of course git. This site is designed to be easy
to install, and works best on a Linux environment.

INSTALL
There are four major steps to getting this site running.

1) Setting up the Database
We currently run the site off of a MySQL Database (version 5+ should work fine).
You will need to create a database and user with basic permissions. (SELECT,
INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

2) Setting up the config file
Once you have the database running and a fresh copy of the sql inserted. You
should look into application/config/, modify and save config.sample.php as
config.php with the DB information.

3) Setting up the Facebook app
You will need to setup a Facebook app for the site to use. If you're doing this
as part of UNIFI, then you should be given access to the app already. If not, ask
the current president. (Or Adam Shannon, adam@unifreethought.com)

Once you have the Facebook app setup on Facebook's servers, you can put the
information in application/config/config.php (notice it should be renamed by now)

3.5) Setting the error display level.
PHP has a build in error reporting system, which is really nice and useful during
development, but some of the errors it gives off are meaningless during production
usage. So, it's best to change the error_reporting from E_ALL to E_NONE when you
put the site into production.

4) Uploading the files
After those three steps you should be ready to upload the php, html, js, css, and
images to the server. You should have FTP access, and if not contact the President
or Adam. Then, visit the site and verify that everything is working.
